# XYZ Reader - Make your App Material project

Redesigned the app to follow the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design/guidelines-overview/) and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

This project gives me an opportunity to improve appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What I learnt?

- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.
